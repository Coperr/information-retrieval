Jan 19, 2014 by NATASHA LONGOThis Is What Happens In Your Stomach When You Consume Packaged Ramen Noodles With a Deadly Preservative Ramen noodles contain Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), which is a byproduct of the petroleum industry and food additive frequently to preserve cheap processed foods. It is one of those chemicals that is neither digestible or beneficial in any way for your body. A gastrointestinal specialist conducted an experiment with a time lapse video inside the stomach, comparing both fresh and preserved ramen noodles. After two hours of digestion, the results were staggering. The first-of-its-kind experiment by Dr. Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital wanted to find out exactly what happens to food in the stomach and digestive tract after consuming ramen noodles. Thanks to the \\\"smart pill,\\\" a camera the size of a multi-vitamin, Dr. Kuo could do his experiment, showing what happens in the gut of someone who ate a package of instant ramen noodles compared to fresh. Dr. Kuo recorded 32 hours from the pill camera. \\\"What we're seeing here is a stomach contracting back and forth as it's trying to grind up the ramen noodles,\\\" Dr. Kuo says of the beginning of the video. For comparison, the study volunteers also ate fresh, homemade ramen noodles on a different day. The video at 20 minutes, and 2 hours, shows a striking difference. \\\"The most striking thing about our experiment when you looked at a time interval, say in one or two hours, we noticed a processed ramen noodles were less broken down that homemade ramen noodles,\\\" noted Dr. Kuo. This affects nutrient absorption and could theoretically allow preservatives to linger longer periods in the stomach cavity before being transported to the intestines and subsequently eliminated. What Is TBHQ? In processed foods, it's sprayed on the food or on its packaging to prevent discoloration and changes to flavor and odor. Others products, such as cosmetics, perfumes, varnishes and lacquers, contain TBHQ to maintain stability. Small amounts of TBHQ may not kill you (although death has occurred) or even make you feel immediately sick, but it can have a long term effect on your health such as weakening of organs and contributing to the onset of cancers and tumors. The FDA says that TBHQ must not exceed 0.02 percent of its oil and fat content. Death has occurred from the ingestion of as little as 5 grams. This would be a considerably high dose compared to the amounts found in foods, but it gives us a good indication on the toxicity level of this preservative. At higher doses, it has some negative health effects on lab animals, such as producing precursors to stomach tumors and damage to DNA. A number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high doses of TBHQ may be carcinogenic, especially for stomach tumors. Ingestion of a single gram (a thirtieth of an ounce) has caused nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, diarrhea, ringing in the ears, delirium, a sense of suffocation, and collapse. Some people have reported having anxiety and night terrors and asthma after ingesting TBHQ. Others have reported having a body rash and swollen lymph nodes. You can find TBHQ in Mc Donald\\u2019s chicken Mcnuggets across the United States, however Mcdonalds European chicken nuggets do not contain the toxic preservative. This is interesting since both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the FDA have evaluated TBHQ and determined that it is safe to consume at the concentration allowed in foods. The EFSA considers TBHQ to be non-carcinogenic, so why do they not allow it in chicken mcnuggets? Other Food Products Containing TBHQ: Mcdonalds chicken nuggets and french fries CHEEZ-IT Crackers made by Kelloggs Butterfinger chocolate and Resee\\u2019s Peanut butter cups Nestle Crunch Wheat Thins Microwave popcorn Pam cooking spray Aldi products Keebler Club crackers Kellogs eggo frozen waffles and many other kellog products Taco bell beans and some taco shells Teddy Grahams Red Barron frozen pizza Keebler Cookies Tasty Kake Little Debbie Kellog\\u2019s Pop-Tarts Homestyle Peanut butter cookies Some forms of soymilk Different breads cerals and crackers could contain TBHQCrisco oil Some pet foods Many cosmetic products and baby products Some hair dyes lipsticks and eyeshadows Wrigley\\u2019s gum Little Debbies nutty bars and some M&M products KFC beans and fried chicken There are many more processed foods not listed above which contain TBHQ. A conclusion that is now quickly reaching vast numbers is that all processed food in general, has far too many problems to be considered safe. Our regulatory agencies are not responsibly catering to the problems and instead of removing these toxins from the food supply, are claiming that safe levels exist. Since when did safe levels exist of any poison entering the body?

So technically, aren't vitamins toxic? Too much sugar can cause diabetes. Toxic. Too much water causes hyponatremia which can be fatal. Toxic. Awareness and moderation in all things. Richard Cheese \\u2022 2 years ago Congratulations. You get the award for idiot of the day. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago They make the point that the dosage is a factor. Vitamin C has no know toxic level, there is a bowel tolerance. I can't imagine a practical way you could kill yourself. The stupid behaviour required to kill yourself through ingestion of water is pretty transparent. The difference is twofold. The real concern is whether the trace amounts of these chemical are harmful. General toxicity may nod in that direction, but they are different issues. Small amounts of vitamin C are great for you, some additives have been found not to be The second issue is what the additive is there for. If a compound is unusual in the human food chain, toxic in some amount, and has no useful purpose post ingestion, why is it in my diet? It may well be useful in some regard, but I would wonder why I am eating it. Vitamin C is not made in the body, is essential to life, has some processing advantages, and is a good thing to eat. Is the difference really so incomprehensible? Another thing about vitamins is they don't change the formula every few years to avoid regulatory oversight. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago Dude, 5 grams is a (figurative) TON when considering toxicity. Think about medications folks take. Usually in the 0.250 - 0.400 g for anitbiotics (sometimes 1g for single dose treatments) or others: 0.080g for the strongest dose of Oxy Contin, 0.010 g for the strongest dose of Ambien, 0.002 g for the strongest dose of Xanax. 5 g is orders of magnitude greater. And I'm assuming that your 5 g statistic is correct, which after this alarmist piece, I am skeptical. Instant Ramen is not going to kill you. Jesus, people are just looking to find things to be alarmed about and just making stuff up. Read the safety section from the wiki page. This is so a non-story: http://en.wikipedia.org/wik... Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Yes, and there are also wikipedia pages on the safety levels of lead, mercury, cadmium and many other heavy metals, yet all of them may accumulate in the body in the long-term and none are theoretically safe at any level. Yet synergeistic toxicity in the body is very real and has been correlated to infant mortality through multi-doses in children http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.... Alan D Smith \\u2022 3 years ago Wikipedia is a total pack of lies. I've tried to correct false information there many times. It always reverted back to the lie in a day or so. As a part of their eternal, covert War On Humanity, the banksters will always be doing all in their power to poison Us to keep their medical and pharmaceutical industries churning up their profits.saywhatuwill \\u2022 4 years ago I'll be sure not to eat \\\"Some pet foods.\\\"T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago Disqus did us all a disserve when it took away the down vote button. T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago These days people are getting cancer at an alarming rate. Besides that obesity, IDDM, hyperlipidemia, HTN and so many illness are on the rise is the US. Just looking at baby-boomers alone research shows they are aging faster and are more ill than the generation before. This can not be a coincidence. I believe it's the inclusion of plastics and preservatives into our food culture. All the items are pointing the source, but it takes time to prove. Also, remember in the 50s/60 when data came forth that cigarettes were causing lung cancer (and later other cancers & illness) there were many criticizing its validity, but it ended up being true. Took a significant amount of years to prove the truth. I say it is time we take heed as consumers. We can not wait on an \\\"official publically approved\\\" proof. We have little pieces of evidence here and there that should suffice. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Well come on. We can pretty much all do the math here. People are working longer, have less quality time spent with loved ones and feeling good, don't meditate, don't walk anywhere ever, eat out of paper bags tossed through windows. All that can't possibly lead us to long life and healthy bodies. James Childress \\u2022 3 years ago That ramen in the gut doesn't look like the consumer actually chewed it. Who swallows ramen whole without chewing it up? Failure to chew will slow down the digestion process. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago EXACTLY what I said! Everyone knows digestion begins in the mouth. This must have been a toothless and very hunger booger to have slurped it down unchewed like that. John \\u2022 3 years ago There was a point in my life where all I ate were ramon noodles - morning, noon and night. I switched to Jack N the Box - had a stroke at 26 and now I cook everything from home. Draw your own conclusions. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago I would think the cumulative effect of a lifelong bad diet did you in at only 26, not switching back to Jack in the Box. Yes, let's draw our own conclusions. Danny Bowen \\u2022 4 years ago Since when did safe levels exist of any poison? So are you saying that since water at certain amounts is \\\"toxic\\\" it is a poison, and therefor at any amounts should not be ingested? Did you THINK before you wrote any of this? Katherine Morgan \\u2022 4 years ago And did YOU think before posting such an absurd response... Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago He did and has an excellent point, Katherine. Almost everything will kill you in extreme excess. Not only does the author not mention how much is in a package of Ramen, but he also fails to understand that 5 g is not a little amount in this context. There are tons of things that are perfectly safe at low doses - and this is one of them. Stop looking for boogiemen in everything. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago No amount of any toxin is safe. Anything natural taken in excess can be toxic, however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. It is a sad reality that people justify foods based on their cost or taste, regardless of their toxicity. And when information is presented even in a video that demonstrates that the same preserved food (vs fresh) is not being broken down by the body, people turn a blind eye and attempt to justify why that is so. They then dismiss the information as alarmist rather than taking a step back thinking \\\"hey maybe this chemical shouldn't be in our food supply?\\\" or \\\"why are we eating anything processed that relies on chemical harmful preservatives at all?\\\" Instead, people argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. It's what we refer to as the sheeple paying tribute and defending those that poison them. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago I'm sorry, but your first statement is patently false. Our bodies deal with and process \\\"toxins\\\" all the time - take for instance apple seeds, which contain a compound which our bodies break down into cyanide. Cyanide can cause asphyxiation in some doses; however, our bodies are capable of metabolizing small doses of cyanide such that eating an apple core - or even 10 apple cores - don't harm us. Toxicity absolutely depends on dosage; there is no chemical so potent that a single molecule will kill us and there is no chemical so inert that a massive quantity will not kill us. Even water kills at sufficiently high doses by creating an extreme imbalance in your electrolytes. So yes, it is completely relevant to ask how much is in a container of ramen. If what you state were true, there would be no food that would pass such a strict standard. Second issue: there are many things we eat which do not digest. Fiber is one of them. Every time you eat a fruit, there is a large part of that which is indigestible. Any time you eat anything, there is a lot that is not digestible. To be blunt, this is why we defecate. I would agree that it's likely better to eat food that we use more of, assuming we still have a certain level of fiber in our diet. Third, chemicals don't scare me, and I wish they wouldn't scare you so much. Everything you eat contains chemicals. You don't even know what half of them are - scientists don't even know what some of them are. There is no complete catalog of every chemical that is in an apple or a stalk of celery or a haunch of organic beef. We eat these chemicals all the time without a thought, and we misattribute this to it being \\\"natural\\\". I say misattribute, because you are cherry-picking (perhaps literally!). You are ignoring all the natural organisms out there which you don't eat because they'd kill you. The potato plant, other than the root, is poisonous, for example. We've had generations upon generations of trial and error to determine generally what won't kill us in the next 24 hours, but we have almost no research on what might kill us after a lifetime of exposure. Who knows, maybe eating those apple seeds every day will produce early onset dimensia, but no one has thought to even study it. We give a pass to \\\"natural\\\" chemical, yet we jump upon man-made chemicals. That's not dispassionate, scientific thinking. I can assure you; I do not have Stockholm syndrome. I eat organically, when I can, because I do think the abundance of antibiotics and hormones we use are likely not good for the environment. But those beliefs are due to scientific study, not hunches. I don't hold a prejudicial attitude against anything man has made. We've made some pretty darn good things and some pretty crappy, harmful things. How could I immediately praise or write them off without doing any dispassionate scientific study? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Great comment!T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I know this is month ago. However, I am wondering if you can answer a general question. Do you think preservatives in our foods are causing inflammation, cancers and other harmful outcomes in the modern human body? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago\\\"however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. \\\"The 'artificial' bit is utter and complete nonsense!And, a substance is considered 'poisonous', when: the dose is within a certain range that causes harm or death; and/or by a particular route of administration (ROA) that exacerbates harm or hastens death by acting via a different mechanism. If no harm is caused by a particular dose or ROA, then the use of the word 'poisonous' is not justified. Colloquially, we call substances (not required in our diet) that cause harm at very low doses, 'poisons' or 'poisonous'. I get that, hence the confusion for some. Don't be constrained by a definition, especially not a colloquial one. Sodium cyanide (Na CN) is generally considered poisonous, because it causes harm at doses as low as say, 5 to 10 mg (I'm just guessing; don't quote me on this), and we do not require it in our diet; but if we were to ingest say 5 nanograms of Na CN, there would be no harm done and nothing to call 'poisonous'. One final thought. Antioxidants (in relation to food) are considered healthful. You will never guess why TBHQ is added as a preservative? It's an antioxidant. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago What are you talking about? Look at soap. It's made with lye which is caustic but mixed properly, it's the bubbly wonderful stuff we use every day in one way or another. Yes...what Michael Cooney said. James Doe \\u2022 4 years ago Just drink vodka and you'll be fine!Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Amen. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago You seem constrained by your own definition of the word 'poison'. All substances can be considered a 'poison'; the dose, and the route of administration, differentiate poisons from benign substances.brothersun \\u2022 3 years ago Maybe the stomach is contracting to try to grind up the pill-cam! Need a control group with no pill-cam to be sure. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago...but without the pill-cam we couldn't see...the pill-cam. LOL!Sweetvegan \\u2022 3 years ago This was not an experiment involving TBHQ. This was an experiment comparing processed v. fresh ramen noodles. David Wierda \\u2022 3 years ago\\\"Aldi products\\\" All of them? Are you serious? Guest \\u2022 3 years ago Richard Cheese \\u2022 2 years ago WTF? Take your nonsene elsewhere idiot. Mike84 \\u2022 2 years ago Right on, I lost 30 pounds in 30 days as well eating Mc Donalds or Taco Bell almost daily. I didn't even buy the \\\"healthy\\\" stuff. I was eating double cheeseburgers, fries, quesaritos, etc. It's all about your total daily intake. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Yes, it mostly is due to your daily caloric intake. Bryan Van Wagner \\u2022 3 years ago Life is fatal. Karen Sherry Brackett \\u2022 4 years ago Good article and interesting list of products containing this chemical. It is in the noodles. Besides making them rubbery it also raises their melting point which increases shelf life but also makes it hard to digest them and harder still ...to get any actual food nutrients from them. A person might as well eat a football. To put this in perspective butyl groups are used in everything from rubber tires to footballs. lol What's worse is their parent base for the chemical is hydroquinone. Here's a warning from the MSDS. Toxicity to Animals: Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 320 mg/kg [Rat.]. Acute dermal toxicity (LD50): 5970 mg/kg [Mammal]. Chronic Effects on Humans: The substance is toxic to lungs, the nervous system, mucous membranes. Karen Sherry Brackett \\u2022 4 years ago To put the MSDS for hydroquinone into perspective.... basically a 160 pound person would need to eat only ounces of 4-butylhydroquinone to reach acute toxicity at which point damage to their lungs and nervous system will start to be exhibited in a pronounced way. So, if barely half a pound taken all at once will produce acute toxicity damage then every exposure less than that will be causing damage as well only to a degree not physically noticeable as a symptom but with the potential to accumulate to the same level of symptom if not worse degrees of damage. So, while the content per package is very small because it is in use in so many products the over all exposure to this chemical is likely to be high and consequently a severe health hazard. This chemical really needs to be banned from all food products in my opinion. Also, keep in that this determination is only based on the parent molecule for hydroquinone and does not even take into account the health effects of the additional four butyl groups to the human body. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago First, 4-butylhydroquinone is NOT the same as t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), so do not get them confused. Second, the potential to accumulate in the system is not possible as it is not stored but excreted, just like most things. You would rupture your digestive system long before you could get to a toxic level before you excreted it. You would have to ingest 5 kilograms of foods to have ingested 1 gram of TBHQ. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Ok, we're clearly coming from different angles Nicholas. We don't share your perspective, but thanks for your feedback. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Again, why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. That's like ordering a pizza and spreading a little bit of drano plumbing powder because it tastes good, but lets not put too much because it's toxic at higher levels. It's a very illogical argument. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago There are toxins in everything. Just breathing introduces toxins into the body. Organically grown foods have toxins, but you do not recommend that we not eat these foods. The normal human body can and does handle these toxins (both natural and man made) with little or no problem. The TBHQ is used as a food preservative in many foods including butter. Without it the foods would not have the ability to be stored, and without that ability these foods would not be available to the majority of people. Not everyone has a cow. Yes freshly made noodles are easier to digest and may be healthier, they are also MUCH more expensive per serving and take time that is not always available for food preparation. T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I think it is about knowledge. If you choose to eat food knowing that it contains harmful items that were not meant to be digested by the body it is your choice. However, it is important that the public has knowledge to make such a choice also. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago Call BS on that. Making your own noodles is far cheaper. Making your own bread pays for the breadmaker in s a few weeks. and noodle makers that used to cost hundreds are pretty cheap also. People don't want to take the time, which is trivial once the routine is down, but they spend the time making the money and shopping. The problem is that the people who get into this stuff want to make flax kumquat bread, etc... And it takes a while to perfect a recipe so they loose interest. There isn't that much interest in using the machines to make a cheap normal bread because that isn't the magic most people are looking for. But is it healthier, fast, and cheaper? Sure. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Of course the human body will handle toxins but the point is, you have hundreds of other choices aside from ramen noodles which do not have this preservative. Any toxins you may consider organically grown foods to contain are grown from the Earth and those can be handled effectively by bodily absorption, distribution, and metabolism whereas many of these type of toxins accumulate in the body and are not as easily metabolized or assimilated. THBQ is not in organic butter. You can make all the excuses in the world to consume preservatives, but in the end that's all they are, excuses because you always have a choice to eat healthier and consume fresh wholesome foods than those which are processed. You always have a choice. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago Yes, the choice is there. Organic butter does not have THBQ. It also does not have a shelf life that makes it marketable except locally. And it does have a higher cost to the consumer. And while many toxins accumulate in the body and are dangerous, THBQ is not one of them. There are many reasons to not consume almost all of the foods that contain THBQ, but the toxicity is a very minor one. Rather you should limit or refrain consumption because of the high fat content of the chicken nuggets and butter, or the EXTREME sodium levels in the ramen flavour packet. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Yes but organic also costs a fortune AND I don't even trust that the little sticker on a supposed organic tomato means anything so I can't justify the cost. How many times has it been revealed that lower level products have been sold masquerading as a more expensive version or brand? It's a shame, though, really that even eating well is a luxury for some. I would have to quadruple my current food budget just to do whatever I could to buy better. I love, love, love fresh veggies and salads, fruits and the whole bit but I have more to do with my money than buy food. Bill De Lozier \\u2022 4 years agoyes , i agree. romans used lead for plumbing and decided wine tastes better in lead vessels. small doses over time are as debilitating as one large dose. the wealthy in ancient Rome became poisened over time and also sterile. their children died young as well. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods\\\"Because at certain doses (and ROAs) these substances ARE NOT TOXINS. Drano is for drains, it was never meant for consumption, furthermore Drano is a mixture of several substances listed below for the crystal formulation:1. sodium hydroxide (aka lye or caustic soda),2. sodium nitrate,3. sodium chloride,4. aluminum (as metal flakes)Number 1 is used to make German pretzels, it's also used to remove a nasty tasting compound from unripe olives (green olives). It's also used to make soap, especially homemade soap. I wonder if green olives are good on pizza? Number 2 is used to cure country hams. A bit of country ham on a pizza might be delicious. I'll keep my eye out for the next Tombstone limited-time speciality pizza with country ham. Yum. Number 3 is found extensively in pizza. It's table salt. Number 4 is used to make aluminum-foil, cookware (pots, pans, cookie sheets, 1/2 and full-sized restaurant style sheet pans, etc.) I use a 1/2 sheet pan lined with aluminum foil to bake my Tombstone pizzas on. Of those substances, sodium hydroxide is the most poisonous, no, actually it's corrosive. Trace amounts in your soap may dry out your skin faster. Trace amounts in pretzels or green olives are not an issue because at those levels (doses) they cause no harm whatsoever. Obviously, a large dose will dissolve your skin or tissue of your esophagus. That's why it's used to clear drains. It breaks down hair, and dead skin. When you make soap, you use sodium hydroxide to convert fat into soap (a fatty acid sodium salt) and glycerine, which can now dissolve in water. It does the same thing to grease in your drain. One can use aluminum cookware with few issues, but if you were to swallow many aluminum metal flakes, they might tear up your digestive tract, or pass through without issue, or cause aluminum poisoning, but it depend on how much you swallowed. Sodium nitrate is probably the most poisonous but only at very high doses. What's left in a country ham causes no harm. It would appear much of Drano is already on, or in, or involved with your pizza. But only a total f*cking idiot would put Drano on his pizza. That would be much too high a dose of FOUR different substances, that when combined with water, create heat and react chemically to unclog drains. I would not want that happening in my stomach, but to continue your Drano analogy, lets say I measure out 1 micro gram of a Drano crystal and swallowed it. Would I die, get sick, or be harmed? Nope. The dose it too low. If this analogy is still insufficient to allow people to comprehend what I originally wrote above, and repeated below...\\\"Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"...then I am at a loss for a better way to explain it. Perhaps my analogue actually sucks; but I must also entertain the slight possibility, that this may be incomprehensible to a few select people. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Hydroquinone is not the same substance as TBHQ. But let's go with your example anyways. 160 lbs / 2.2 kg/lbs = 72.7 kg. 5970 mg/kg x 72.7 kg = 434,019 mg 434,019 mg / 1000 mg/g = 434 g434 g = 15. 3 oz (I Googled it) Your mammals would have to eat just under a pound of hydroquinone before half of them would die. That seems pretty darned safe to me. Your calculation was a bit off but you were in the ballpark. It's odd you said \\\"'barely' half a pound taken at once\\\" Is not a half of a pound a lot of hydroquinone? This is not the amount of food you would have to eat, but the amount of pure hydroquinone you would have to eat. Now ask how much food you would need to eat as a test mammal to consume 15.3 oz of pure hydroquinone? IDK, cause it's not the substance in question, but I'll bet it is lots.

He has frequent run-ins with the Shinies, who are presumed to be the kind group of spirits and are attracted to shiny objects. The Shadows show tremendous power throughout the season, forcing President Bedford, the president of Rockland University to blow up Delia's real estate office. At the end of the series, Melinda and Jim try to protect Aiden by convincing him that ghosts don't exist (at the advice of Carl the Watcher, later revealed to be under the influence of the Shadows). The Shadows gradually begin to take possession of Melinda's body. Aiden is told by Carl that he must go to Melinda's store. Jim, Ned, Eli and Delia follow with him. Melinda is inside, being engulfed by the Shadows. Aiden, who has forged a friendship with one of the Shinies (previously revealed to be the ghosts of children), enlists their help. In the town square, dozens of Shinies gather, and emit a bright light. The Shinies and their light become visible to passersby in the square. Inside the store, the Shadows are trying to battle the light and fully possess Melinda, but fail on both accounts. Melinda drops to the ground and the group run in. Later that night, Aiden is in his room and Melinda and Jim enter. Melinda tells him that they should both be proud of their gift and that he was her hero that night. Aiden replies that Melinda is a hero every day, and the series closes with a shot of Melinda smiling and tearing up. Development [ edit]Ghost Whisperer is based on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" James Van Praagh, [3] who is co- executive producer [4] and regularly updates a blog about the show through Living TV. [5] The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" Mary Ann Winkowski. [6] Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere. [7]The show was produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three). The show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles. [8] One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future trilogy, though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview. For example, the clock tower in Back to the Future has been completely covered up. Cast and crew members believe that the set gets visits from real spirits. [9]Sound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound. [10] Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works. [11] Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX. [12]Creator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn, New York, which is not far from Grandview-On-Hudson, west of the Hudson River. Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town, which is accurate to real life as Grandview-On-Hudson is actually located just north of Piermont. Professor Rick Payne worked in the fictional \\\"Rockland University\\\", and perhaps not coincidentally, the actual Grandview, New York is a village located in Rockland County, New York. Syndication [ edit]On May 5, 2008 it was announced that the first three seasons of Ghost Whisperer were purchased for $169.8 million ($700,000 per episode, per network) for syndication by Sy Fy, ION Television, and WE TV. Episodes began airing in Summer 2009 on ION, and in Fall 2009 on Sy Fy and WE. [13] The first four seasons began airing in syndication on CBC Television in Canada on August 31, 2009. [14]Cancellation [ edit]On May 18, 2010, citing rising costs and a decline in viewership, CBS announced that Ghost Whisperer would not be renewed for another season. [15] On May 18, 2010, CBS cancelled the show after five seasons. [16] ABC expressed interest in picking up Ghost Whisperer for Fall 2010. [17] [18] It was revealed on May 19, that writers of the show were informed to not look for other jobs yet, and the producers were very optimistic that there was a good chance of Ghost Whisperer being renewed by ABC. [19] On May 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello reported that ABC had passed on renewing Ghost Whisperer for its sixth season. [20]Zap2it declared Ghost Whisperer is the second \\\"most missed axed show\\\" after a poll determined 17.1 percent of voters would miss it. [21] In October 2010, Jennifer Love Hewitt thanked the fans of the show for their support in a goodbye video (filmed in June, 2010), saying \\\"Your love and support has meant everything to the cast and crew of Ghost Whisperer and we will all miss you guys very, very much. Go get our DVDs, think about us, miss us and know how much we all will miss you. Much love.\\\" She was visibly emotional during the video and simply waved to the camera at the end of the video as she was unable to finish speaking.

Takara swam around the tank as she gave birth (Image: REUTERS)It also vowed to phase out killer whale shows at its three parks in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California and San Antonio. \\\"This is the last one, and that makes this a particularly big deal,\\\" Sea World Chief Zoological Officer Chris Dold said. \\\"It is a bit bitter sweet.

There have been various slide-to-unlock methods and OEMs have always put their own spin on things. As it turns out, there are also a lot of lock screen apps in the Play Store that can do even more. They\\u2019re not as popular as they used to be. However, many people still enjoy the allure of a new lock screen. These days, we usually recommend people just use a finger print scanner to bypass the lock screen altogether. It\\u2019s okay if you don\\u2019t want to do that, though. Here are the best lock screen apps for Android!Here are some more excellent customization apps!15 best Android launcher apps of 201710 best Android themes Ac Display Price: Free / $1-$80DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAc Display is one of the most popular lock screen apps. It emulates the always-on lock screens of devices like the Moto X, Galaxy S8, and others. Users can play with notifications without unlocking their display. It also features some customizations. For instance, you can set it to work only during certain hours to save battery life. More and more devices are coming stock with something similar. Thus, we'd only recommend Ac Display to those with older devices that don't already have this feature. Its last update was in 2015. We're not sure if the developer is doing much with it anymore. At the very least, it's free to download and play with. Alarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAlarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock is an older app. However, its features are still very relevant today. It focuses more on security than anything else. Instead of being ridiculously secure, the app is ridiculously annoying. Someone putting in the wrong passcode will make your phone sound off very loud alarms. It'll also vibrate, blink the screen, and cause a general ruckus. In other words, you will know if someone is getting into your phone. It's one of the few free lock screen apps. Just don't mess up your passcode. Seriously. CM Locker Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMost of Cheetah Mobile's apps are trash. This one isn't so bad. It's a lock screen app and applock hybrid. It features the usual array of security precautions along with the ability to lock apps as needed. That way even if hackers get through the lock screen, they still can't easily get into your apps. The app also features HD wallpapers, notification support, a news feed, and intruder selfies. There are some advertisements. They may or may not bother you depending on your tolerance for such things. It is otherwise free with no in-app purchases. Dash Clock Widget Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYDash Clock Widget isn't technically a lock screen app. It's actually a lock screen widget. However, it still works for a list like this. It delivers the basic stats like time, weather, and some notifications. There are extensions available that increase the number of things you can do. It's actually more effective than most lock screen apps. However, it's only available on devices running Android 4.2-4.4. The number of people with devices running that gets smaller every year. It's still perfectly usable as a home screen widget, though!Echo Notification Lock Screen Price: Free / Up to $4.49DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYEcho Notification is one of those lock screen apps that focuses on notifications. It'll pop them up on your lock screen as you receive them. It's not too different from what we have now in the stock lock screens. However, it's still a fresh take on the idea. The app itself is minimal and easy to use. You can also group notifications into categories like social, work, etc. It also has additional customization features. It's free to try and you can unlock the pro version as an in-app purchase. Here are some more related and recommended app lists!10 best security apps for Android that aren\\u2019t antivirus apps10 best icon packs for Android (by developer)GO Locker Price: Free / $14.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYGO Locker is among the most popular lock screen apps.

Hi Locker Price: Free / $1.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYHi Locker is a fairly typical lock screen replacement app. It'll show you the basics such as weather, notifications, calendar events, etc. You can also have it greet you with funny quips and greetings.

For instance, you can have it hide notifications from certain apps so people can't see it.

Lok Lok Price: Free with in-app purchases DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYLok Lok is different from most lock screen apps. It's almost kind of a mash-up of a lock screen and Snapchat. Turning on the device will open your camera. You can take a picture, draw on that picture, and then send it to your friends or loved ones. They'll see the image when they unlock their phone next and can respond accordingly. It's not great for sending risque pictures, but it's excellent for reminding someone to grab milk on their way home from work. The app is free to use.

Do you know anyone who has a well-defined sense of what their values and goals are in life and are highly committed to making them happen? If so, you that person has reached identity achievement. Learn more about identity achievement from this lesson and test your knowledge with a quiz. James Marcia and Identity James Marcia is a Canadian developmental psychologist who is known for his theory of identity development. Following up on Erik Erikson's concepts of identity crisis and identity confusion, Marcia believes that there are 4 processes that adolescents can go through as they develop their identity. Marcia called these processes identity statuses. An adolescent's identity status depends on two conditions: If the adolescent is actively searching for, or exploring, their identity, and if the adolescent is dedicated to, or made a commitment to, any personal values or beliefs. Marcia's four identity statuses are: Identity Diffusion: Adolescents have not yet attempted to find their identity, nor do they have a clear picture of what their identity may be. They have not set any goals for themselves. Identity diffusion is characterized by low commitment and low exploration. Identity Foreclosure: Adolescents have blindly accepted and committed to values and beliefs taught to them by their family, community, or significant others without exploring alternatives. They do not question the values that were taught to them. Identity foreclosure is characterized by high commitment and low exploration. Identity Moratorium: Adolescents are actively experiencing a crisis which has led them to explore their identity and values. However, they have not yet committed to any values or beliefs and are instead experimenting. Identity moratorium is characterized by low commitment and high exploration. Identity Achievement: After a process of active exploration, adolescents have made a strong commitment to a highly developed set of beliefs and values. Identity achievement is characterized by high commitment and high exploration. These four statuses are not sequential. For example, an adolescent may begin at the identity diffusion status and jump right into identity achievement. Though all adolescents will eventually experience at least one of the four identity statuses, they do not have to go through all four statuses. So what does identity achievement in adolescence look like? Example of Identity Achievement Adolescents at the identity achievement stage have actively explored and examined different values and beliefs and have finally chosen those that are most important to them. They are able to sort out who they want to be and what their life's purpose is. They realize what their priorities are. These adolescents are also confident and positive that they chose the right values and beliefs. Let's take Sally, for example. Sally's parents and grandparents are both medical doctors, and as college students they all went to the same medical school.

Although Sally thought the world of her parents, she did not think that she wanted to spend all of her time caring for sick people. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.

Tech Note: Pixel Response Effects on CCD Camera Gain Calibration Author: Michael Newberry, Ph. D., Mirametrics, Inc. Overview The gain of a CCD camera is the conversion between the number of electrons (\\\"e-\\\") recorded by the CCD and the number of digital units (\\\"counts\\\") contained in the CCD image. It is useful to know this conversion for evaluating the performance of the CCD camera. Since quantities in the CCD image can only be measured in units of counts, knowing the gain permits the calculation of quantities such as readout noise and full well capacity in the fundamental units of electrons. The gain value is required by some types of image deconvolution such as Maximum Entropy since, in order to correctly handle the statistical part of the calculation, the processing needs to convert the image into units of electrons. Calibrating the gain is also useful for detecting electronic problems in a CCD camera, including gain change at high or low signal level, and the existence of unexpected noise sources. This White Paper develops the mathematical theory behind the gain calculation and shows how the mathematics suggests ways to measure the gain accurately. This note does not address the issues of basic image processing or CCD camera operation, and a basic understanding of CCD bias, dark and flat field correction is assumed. CCD Camera Gain The gain value is set by the electronics that read out the CCD chip. Gain is expressed in units of electrons per count. For example, a gain of 1.8 e-/count means that the camera produces 1 count for every 1.8 recorded electrons. Of course, we cannot split electrons into fractional parts, as in the case for a gain of 1.8 e-/count. What this number means is that 4/5 of the time 1 count is produced from 2 electrons, and 1/5 of the time 1 count is produced from 1 electron. This number is an average conversion ratio, based on changing large numbers of electrons into large numbers of counts. Note: This use of the term \\\"gain\\\" is in the opposite sense to the way a circuit designer would use the term since, in electronic design, gain is considered to be an increase in the number of output units compared with the number of input units. It is important to note that every measurement you make in a CCD image uses units of counts. Since one camera may use a different gain than another camera, count units do not provide a straightforward comparison to be made. For example, suppose two cameras each record 24 electrons in a certain pixel. If the gain of the first camera is 2.0 and the gain of the second camera is 8.0, the same pixel would measure 12 counts in the image from the first camera and 3 counts in the image from the second camera. Without knowing the gain, comparing 12 counts against 3 counts is pretty meaningless. Before a camera is assembled, the manufacturer can use the nominal tolerances of the electronic components to estimate the gain to within some level of uncertainty. This calculation is based on resistor values used in the gain stage of the CCD readout electronics. However, since the actual resistance is subject to component tolerances, the gain of the assembled camera may be quite different from this estimate. The actual gain can only be determined by actual performance in a gain calibration test. In addition, manufacturers sometimes do not perform an adequate gain measurement. Because of these issues, it is not unusual to find that the gain of a CCD camera differs substantially from the value quoted by the manufacturer. Background The signal recorded by a CCD and its conversion from units of electrons to counts can be mathematically described in a straightforward way. Understanding the mathematics validates the gain calculation technique described in the next section, and it shows why simpler techniques fail to give the correct answer. This derivation uses the concepts of \\\"signal\\\" and \\\"noise\\\". CCD performance is usually described in terms of signal to noise ratio, or \\\"S/N\\\", but we shall deal with them separately here. The signal is defined as the quantity of information you measure in the image\\u2014in other words, the signal is the number of electrons recorded by the CCD or the number of counts present in the CCD image. The noise is the uncertainty in the signal. Since the photons recorded by the CCD arrive in random packets (courtesy of nature), observing the same source many times records a different number of electrons every time. This variation is a random error, or \\\"noise\\\" that is added to the true signal. You measure the gain of the CCD by comparing the signal level to the amount of variation in the signal. This works because the relationship between counts and electrons is different for the signal and the variance. There are two ways to make this measurement: Measure the signal and variation within the same region of pixels at many intensity levels. Measure the signal and variation in a single pixel at many intensity levels. Both of these methods are detailed in section 6. They have the same mathematical foundation. To derive the relationship between signal and variance in a CCD image, let us define the following quantities: S CThe signal measured in count units in the CCD image S EThe signal recorded in electron units by the CCD chip. This quantity is unknown. N CThe total noise measured in count units in the CCD image. N EThe total noise in terms of recorded electrons. This quantity is unknown.g The gain, in units of electrons per count. This will be calculated. R EThe readout noise of the CCD, in [electrons]. This quantity is unknown.s EThe photon noise in the signal N Es o An additional noise source in the image. This is described below. We need an equation to relate the number of electrons, which is unknown, to quantities we measure in the CCD image in units of counts. The signals and noises are simply related through the gain factor asand These can be inverted to giveand The noise is contributed by various sources. We consider these to be readout noise, R E, photon noise attributable to the nature of light,, and some additional noise,, which will be shown to be important in in the following Section. Remembering that the different noise sources are independent of each other, they add in quadrature. This means that they add as the square their noise values. If we could measure the total noise in units of electrons, the various noise sources would combine in the following way: The random arrival rate of photons controls the photon noise,. Photon noise obeys the laws of Poissonian statistics, which makes the square of the noise equal to the signal, or. Therefore, we can make the following substitution:. Knowing how the gain relates units of electrons and counts, we can modify this equation to read as follows:which then gives We can rearrange this to get the final equation: This is the equation of a line in which is the y axis, is the x axis, and the slope is 1/ g. The extra terms are grouped together for the time being. Below, they will be separated, as the extra noise term has a profound effect on the method we use to measure gain. A better way to apply this equation is to plot our measurements with as the y axis and as the x axis, as this gives the gain directly as the slope. Theoretically, at least, one could also calculate the readout noise,, from the point where the line hits the y axis at = 0. Knowing the gain then allows this to be converted to a Readout Noise in the standard units of electrons. However, finding the intercept of the line is not a good method, because the readout noise is a relatively small quantity and the exact path where the line passes through the y axis is subject to much uncertainty. With the mathematics in place, we are now ready to calculate the gain. So far, I have ignored the \\\"extra noise term\\\", . In the next 2 sections, I will describe the nature of the extra noise term and show how it affects the way we measure the gain of a CCD camera. Crude Estimation of the Gain Obtain images at different signal levels and subtract the bias from them. This is necessary because the bias level adds to the measured signal but does not contribute noise. Measure the signal and noise in each image. The mean and standard deviation of a region of pixels give these quantities. Square the noise value to get a variance at each signal level. For each image, plot Signal on the y axis against Variance on the x axis. Find the slope of a line through the points. The gain equals the slope. Is measuring the gain actually this simple? Well, yes and no. If we actually make the measurement over a substantial range of signal, the data points will follow a curve rather than a line. Using the present method we will always measure a slope that is too shallow, and with it we will always underestimate the gain. Using only low signal levels, this method can give a gain value that is at least \\\"in the ballpark\\\" of the true value. At low signal levels, the curvature is not apparent, though present. However, the data points have some amount of scatter themselves, and without a long baseline of signal, the slope might not be well determined. The curvature in the Signal - Variance plot is caused by the extra noise term which this simple method neglects. The following factors affect the amount of curvature we obtain: The color of the light source. Blue light is worse because CCD\\u2019s show the greatest surface irregularity at shorter wavelengths. These irregularities are described in Section 5. The fabrication technology of the CCD chip. These issues determine the relative strength of the effects described in item 1. The uniformity of illumination on the CCD chip. If the Illumination is not uniform, then the sloping count level inside the pixel region used to measure it inflates the measured standard deviation. Fortunately, we can obtain the proper value by doing just a bit more work. We need to change the experiment in a way that makes the data plot as a straight line. We have to devise a way to account for the extra noise term,. If were a constant value we could combine it with the constant readout noise. We have not talked in detail about readout noise, but we have assumed that it merges together all constant noise sources that do not change with the signal level. The Extra Noise Term in the Signal-Variance Relationship The mysterious extra noise term,, is attributable to pixel-to-pixel variations in the sensitivity of the CCD, known as the flat field effect. The flat field effect produces a pattern of apparently \\\"random\\\" scatter in a CCD image. Even an exposure with infinite signal to noise ratio (\\\"S/N\\\") shows the flat field pattern. Despite its appearance, the pattern is not actually random because it repeats from one image to another. Changing the color of the light source changes the details of the pattern, but the pattern remains the same for all images exposed to light of the same spectral makeup. The importance of this effect is that, although the flat field variation is not a true noise, unless it is removed from the image it contributes to the noise you actually measure. We need to characterize the noise contributed by the flat field pattern in order to determine its effect on the variance we measure in the image. This turns out to be quite simple: Since the flat field pattern is a fixed percentage of the signal, the standard deviation, or \\\"noise\\\" you measure from it is always proportional to the signal. For example, a pixel might be 1% less sensitive than its left neighbor, but 3% less sensitive than its right neighbor. Therefore, exposing this pixel at the 100 count level produces the following 3 signals: 101, 100, 103. However, exposing at the 10,000 count level gives these results: 10,100, 10,000, 10,300. The standard deviation for these 3 pixels is counts for the low signal case but is counts for the high signal case. Thus the standard deviation is 100 times larger when the signal is also 100 times larger. We can express this proportionality between the flat field \\\"noise\\\" and the signal level in a simple mathematical way: In the present example, we have k =0.02333. Substituting this expression for the flat field variation into our master equation, we get the following result: With a simple rearrangement of the terms, this reveals a nice quadratic function of signal: When plotted with the Signal on the x axis, this equation describes a parabola that opens upward. Since the Signal - Variance plot is actually plotted with Signal on the y axis, we need to invert this equation to solve for S C: This final equation describes the classic Signal - Variance plot. In this form, the equation describes a family of horizontal parabolas that open toward the right. The strength of the flat field variation, k, determines the curvature. When k = 0, the curvature goes away and it gives the straight line relationship we desire. The curvature to the right of the line means that the stronger the flat field pattern, the more the variance is inflated at a given signal level. This result shows that it is impossible to accurately determine the gain from a Signal - Variance plot unless we know one of two things: Either 1) we know the value of k, or 2) we setup our measurements to avoid flat field effects. Option 2 is the correct strategy. Essentially, the weakness of the method described in Section 4 is that it assumes that a straight line relationship exists but ignores flat field effects. To illustrate the effect of flat field variations, mathematical models were constructed using the equation above with parameters typical of commonly available CCD cameras. These include readout noise R E = 15e- and gain g = 2.0 e- / Count. Three models were constructed with flat field parameters k = 0, k = 0.005, and k = 0.01. Flat field variations of this order are not uncommon. These models are shown in the figure below. Increasing values of k correspond to progressively larger flat field irregularities in the CCD chip. The amplitude of flat field effects, k, tends to increase with shorter wavelength, particularly with thinned CCD's (this is why Section 4 recommends using a redder light source to illuminate the CCD). The flat field pattern is present in every image exposed to light. Clearly, it can be seen from the models that if one simply obtains images at different signal levels and measures the variance in them, then fitting a line through any part of the curve yields a slope lower than its true value. Thus the simple method of section 4 always underestimates the gain. The best strategy for doing the Signal - Variance method is to find a way to produce a straight line by properly compensating for flat field effects. This is important by the \\\"virtue of straightness\\\": Deviation from a straight line is completely unambiguous and easy to detect. It avoids the issue of how much curvature is attributable to what cause. The electronic design of a CCD camera is quite complex, and problems can occur, such as gain change at different signal levels or unexplained extra noise at high or low signal levels. Using a \\\"robust\\\" method for calculating gain, any significant deviation from a line is a diagnostic of possible problems in the camera electronics. Two such methods are described in the following section. In previous sections, the so-called simple method of estimating the gain was shown to be an oversimplification. Specifically, it produces a Signal - Variance plot with a curved relationship resulting from flat field effects. This section presents two robust methods that correct the flat field effects in the Signal - Variance relationship to yield the desired straight-line relationship. This permits an accurate gain value to be calculated. Adjusting the method to remove flat field effects is a better strategy than either to attempt to use a low signal level where flat field effects are believed not to be important or to attempt to measure and compensate for the flat field parameter k. When applying the robust methods described below, one must consider some procedural issues that apply to both: Both methods measure sets of 2 or more images at each signal level. An image set is defined as 2 or more successive images taken under the same illumination conditions. To obtain various signal levels, it is better to change the intensity received by the CCD than to change the exposure time. This may be achieved either by varying the light source intensity or by altering the amount of light passing into the camera. The illumination received by the CCD should not vary too much within a set of images, but it does not have to be truly constant. Cool the CCD camera to reduce the dark current to as low as possible. This prevents you from having to subtract dark frames from the images (doing so adds noise, which adversely affects the noise measurements at low signal level). In addition, if the bias varies from one frame to another, be sure to subtract a bias value from every image. The CCD should be illuminated the same way for all images within a set. Irregularities in illumination within a set are automatically removed by the image processing methods used in the calibration. It does not matter if the illumination pattern changes when you change the intensity level for a different image set. Within an image set, variation in the light intensity is corrected by normalizing the images so that they have the same average signal within the same pixel region. The process of normalizing multiplies the image by an appropriate constant value so that its mean value within the pixel region matches that of other images in the same set. Multiplying by a constant value does not affect the signal to noise ratio or the flat field structure of the image. Do not estimate the CCD camera's readout noise by calculating the noise value at zero signal. This is the square root of the variance where the gain line intercepts the y axis. Especially do not use this value if bias is not subtracted from every frame. To calculate the readout noise, use the \\\"Two Bias\\\" method and apply the gain value determined from this test. In the Two Bias Method, 2 bias frames are taken in succession and then subtracted from each other. Measure the standard deviation inside a region of, say 100x100 pixels and divide by 1.4142. This gives the readout noise in units of counts. Multiply this by the gain factor to get the Readout Noise in units of electrons. If bias frames are not available, cool the camera and obtain two dark frames of minimum exposure, then apply the Two Bias Method to them. Method 1: Correct the flat field effects at each signal level In this strategy, the flat field effects are removed by subtracting one image from another at each signal level. Here is the recipe: For each intensity level, do the following: Obtain 2 images in succession at the same light level. Call these images A and B. Subtract the bias level from both images. Keep the exposure short so that the dark current is negligibly small. If the dark current is large, you should also remove it from both frames. Measure the mean signal level S in a region of pixels on images A and B. Call these mean signals S A and S B. It is best if the bounds of the region change as little as possible from one image to the next. The region might be as small as 50x50 to 100x100 pixels but should not contain obvious defects such as cosmic ray hits, dead pixels, etc. Calculate the ratio of the mean signal levels as r = S A / S B. Multiply image B by the number r. This corrects image B to the same signal level as image A without affecting its noise structure or flat field variation. Subtract image B from image A. The flat field effects present in both images should be cancelled to within the random errors. Measure the standard deviation over the same pixel region you used in step 3. Square this number to get the Variance. In addition, divide the resulting variance by 2.0 to correct for the fact that the variance is doubled when you subtract one similar image from another. Use the Signal from step 3 and the Variance from step 7 to add a data point to your Signal - Variance plot. Change the light intensity and repeat steps 1 through 8. Method 2: Avoid flat field effects using one pixel in many images. This strategy avoids the flat field variation by considering how a single pixel varies among many images. Since the variance is calculated from a single pixel many times, rather than from a collection of different pixels, there is no flat field variation. To calculate the variance at a given signal level, you obtain many frames, measure the same pixel in each frame, and calculate the variance among this set of values. One problem with this method is that the variance itself is subject to random errors and is only an estimate of the true value. To obtain a reliable variance, you must use 100\\u2019s of images at each intensity level. This is completely analogous to measuring the variance over a moderate sized pixel region in Method A; in both methods, using many pixels to compute the variance gives a more statistically sound value. Another limitation of this method is that it either requires a perfectly stable light source or you have to compensate for light source variation by adjusting each image to the same average signal level before measuring its pixel. Altogether, the method requires a large number of images and a lot of processing. For this reason, Method A is preferred. In any case, here is the recipe: Select a pixel to measure at the same location in every image. Always measure the same pixel in every image at every signal level. For each intensity level, do the following: Obtain at least 100 images in succession at the same light level. Call the first image A and the remaining images i. Since you are interested in a single pixel, the images may be small, of order 100x100 pixels. Subtract the bias level from each image. Keep the exposure short so that the dark is negligibly small. If the dark current is large, you should also remove it from every frame. Measure the mean signal level S in a rectangular region of pixels on image A. Measure the same quantity in each of the remaining images. The measuring region might be as small as 50x50 to 100x100 pixels and should be centered on the brightest part of the image. For each image S other than the first, calculate the ratio of its mean signal level to that of image A. This gives a number for each image, r = S A / S. Multiply each image i by the number r. This corrects each image to the same average intensity as image A. Measure the number of counts in the selected pixel in every one of the images. From these numbers, compute a mean count and standard deviation. Square the standard deviation to get the variance. Use the Signal and Variance from step 6 to add a data point to your Signal - Variance plot. Change the light intensity and repeat steps 1 through 7. Summary We have derived the mathematical relationship between Signal and Variance in a CCD image which includes the pixel-to-pixel response variations among the image pixels. This \\\"flat field\\\" effect must be compensated or the calculated value of the camera gain will be incorrect. We have shown how the traditional \\\"simple\\\" method used for gain calculation leads to an erroneous gain value unless flat field effects are not considered. We have suggested 2 methods that correctly account for the flat field effect, and these should be implemented in camera testing procedures. \",\n          \"Menards in Portage to close as Gull Road store opens By Al Jones | ajones5@mlive.com Follow on Twitter on August 13, 2015 at 5:52 AMA sign at the Menards store on Mall Drive in Portage.

(Not enough sales? Not cost-effective to renovate? Antiquated design? )A: \\\"In an effort to provide all the latest, greatest home improvements products for all the loyal Menards shoppers in this area, we replaced an older, smaller store in this market with a brand new Kalamazoo East Menards store located about 15 miles away at 5300 Gull Road in Kalamazoo. The new store was built in our largest format and will have several great departments, a full-service lumberyard featuring a covered warehouse, beautiful garden center, appliances, pet and wildlife section, and even a line of convenience groceries for a one-stop shopping experience. \\\"Q: Was that the plan when Menards decided to build the new store? A:\\\"Yes. \\\"Q: When will the new store open and how large is it? (The sign on the old store indicates the new Kalamazoo East store will be a mega-Menards.) A: \\\"Kalamazoo East will be opening on Tuesday, Sept. 1st. Although the exact square footage is unavailable, this huge store has wide aisles, many great displays and all the materials and tools for all of your home improvement projects from just needing a light bulb, gallon of paint or household supplies to building a deck, fence or new home.\\\" (The store, which is all but complete, was initially expected to be more than 240,000 square feet. That includes a 158,400-square-foot main building, a 40,172-square-foot lumber yard, a 27,648-square-foot garden center and a 12,960-square-foot outside storage area. Q: Will the workers from the Portage store that is closing be rehired at the Kalamazoo East store? A: \\\"All employees at our Portage store were offered positions at Kalamazoo East Menards or other Menards stores in the area.\\\" (Menards also has a store that opened in April of 2001 at 6800 W. Main St. in Oshtemo Township. )Q: How many workers does the Portage store employ? How many will the new Kalamazoo-East store employ? A: \\\"These numbers are not available.\\\" (Menards stores are estimated to employ 150-175 employees, with typically half of those being part-time workers. )Menards announced plans in 2012 to build the Kalamazoo East store in the Gull Crossing Mall. It anticipated an August 2013 opening but the project was delayed and construction started on April 7, 2014. Menards is a family-owned chain of more than 280 stores in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It sell materials for home improvement projects, including lawn and garden care supplies as well as tools, hardware, paint, appliances, patio furniture, appliances and other goods.
